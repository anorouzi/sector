==================================================================================

I. Installation

SECTOR Servers currently only works on Linux system. Simple use "make" to compile 
the source code and the generated executables can be found in ./server and ./client 
respectively.

SECTOR uses dynamic libraries, which can be found in ./lib directory.

Note:
1. Do NOT use GCC version 3.3. If you have multiple versions of GCC in your system, 
change Makefile.common and ./udt/Makefile to use the proper version.
2. SECTOR requres libssl-dev to compile.


II. Configuration
The only configuration file is ./server/sector.conf. You may need to edit this file 
to assign a specific location for file storage and port numbers.


III. Server

The server program is located at ./server directory. For a stand-alone server, run 
./cbfs <LOCAL IP ADDRESS> 

For more servers:
./cbfs <LOCAL IP ADDRESS> <REMOTE IP ADDRESS> <REMOTE PORT>

For example,
If you start the first server on 10.0.0.1 at port 2237, run ./cbfs 10.0.0.1. The port 
number "2237" is specified in configuration file sector.conf.
Then if you start the second server on 10.0.0.2, run ./cbfs 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.1 2237


IV. Client

The client programs are located at ./client directory. There are two applications. 
"download" is used to download files to a local disk.

./download <IP> <PORT> <FILE LIST> <LOCAL DIRECTORY>

In particular, the <FILE LIST> is an ASCII file with a list of file names, one per row.

"upload" is to upload a file to a server.

./upload <IP> <PORT> <SRC FILE> [DST FILE]

The above command uploads a local file <SRC FILE> to the server <IP:PORT> with the 
destination name of [DST FILE]. The destination name is optional. If it is not used, 
the file on the server will have the same name as <SRC FILE>.

Note that SECTOR is a flat file system. There is no directory structure, so every file 
must have a unique file name. In addition, the client cannot modify or overwrite a file 
unless the file is originally uploaded by the same client.

The SECTOR client also works on Windows system.


V. Need help?
SECTOR is really new, the document is far from complete, and it could be buggy. Please 
feel free to contact Yunhong Gu <gu at lac dot uic dot edu>. Thanks!
