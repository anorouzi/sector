I. Installation

SECTOR Servers currently only works on Linux system. Simple use "make" to compile the source 
code and the generated executables can be found in ./server and ./client respectively.

SECTOR uses dynamic libraries, which can be found in ./lib directory.

Note:
1. Do NOT use GCC version 3.3. If you have multiple versions of GCC in your system, change 
Makefile.common and ./udt/Makefile to use the proper version.
2. SECTOR requres libssl-dev to compile.


II. Configuration
The only configuration file is ./server/sector.conf. You may need to edit this file to assign
a specific location for file storage and port numbers.


III. Server

The server program is located at ./server directory. For a stand-alone server, run 
./cbfs <LOCAL IP ADDRESS> 

For more servers:
./cbfs <LOCAL IP ADDRESS> <REMOTE IP ADDRESS> <REMOTE PORT>

For example,
If you are start the first server on 10.0.0.1 at port 2237, run ./cbfs 10.0.0.1
Then if you are start the second server on 10.0.0.2, run ./cbfs 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.1 2237


IV. Client

The client programs are located at ./client directory. There are two applications. "download"
is used to download files to a local disk.

./download <IP> <PORT> <FILE LIST> <LOCAL DIRECTORY>

In particular, the <FILE LIST> is an ASCII file with a list of file names, one per row.

"upload" is to upload a file to a server.

./upload <IP> <PORT> <SRC FILE> [DST FILE]

The above command uploads a local file <SRC FILE> to the server <IP:PORT> with the destination
name of [DST FILE]. The destination name is optional. If it is not used, the file on the server will
have the same name as <SRC FILE>.

Note that SECTOR is a flat file system. There is no directory structure, so every file must have a 
unique file name. In addition, the client cannot modify or overwrite a file unless the file is 
originally uploaded by the same client.

The SECTOR client also works on Windows system.
